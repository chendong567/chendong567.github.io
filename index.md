## About Me

I am an assistant professor at the Institute of Psychology, Chinese Academy of Sciences. Before that, I was a post-doc researcher at the Institute of Psychology, Chinese Academy of Sciences. Before that, I completed my Ph.D. in system science at Beijing Normal University, China. 

## Research Interests

My research interest is Cognitive Map in awake and sleep. I use intracranial EEG to study its neural basis and how it relates to memory encoding/retrieval/consolidation for optimal action.
